## Adjusting Locomotive Train Symbols in Waycross Based on Shifts

For efficient and synchronized operations across different time zones, it is essential when operating yard power in Waycross to update the train symbols according to the specific symbols listed. To ensure seamless communication and scheduling, align all local times with Eastern Standard Time (EST), which is UTC-5. This practice standardizes time references for all personnel involved in train scheduling and operations, enhancing overall coordination.
