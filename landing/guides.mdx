# Looking to create a guide?

Creating a guide requires effort, careful consideration, and appropriate structuring. Many of our guides are developed through extensive research from credible resources and the insights of our numerous members within Forever Rail. 

Do you have information on a topic that we have not yet covered? Excellent! Please submit it to us, and we will publish it promptly.

Please make sure to complete the following checklist before submitting your guide:

1. Determine the purpose and scope of the guide.
2. Organize the guide via headings, paragraphs and other acceptable formatting.
3. Use clear, concise langauage and if you include specific jargon, please explain it via italics.
4. Use visuals, such as images, diagrams, or any other type of visual aid.
5. Use formatting to make the guide easy to read and navigate. 
6. Include examples if you'd like but it is not required.
7. Double-check grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors.

<Tip>If you need illustrations similar to the one in our L711 guide, please contact us at guides@foreverrail.com.</Tip>

After you have completed the checklist mentioned above, kindly create a new email in your inbox and attach your guide in either .doc or .pdf format before sending it to guides@foreverrail.com. 
We will review your guide and get back to you if we have any questions or concerns.
